# 🎮 Game Hub

**Welcome to the Future of Game Stores.**

Game Hub is a next-generation digital storefront designed to bring the excitement of AAA gaming directly to your screen. We've ditched the boring, static lists for a fully immersive, cinematic experience that feels as alive as the games you play.

## 🌟 What is Game Hub?

Imagine walking into a digital arcade from the year 2077. Game Hub is a concept project that reimagines how we browse and buy video games. It combines sleek design with high-performance tech to create a website that is beautiful, fast, and fun to use.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **Cinematic Experience:** The site opens with a stunning, movie-like showcase. Currently featuring **Grand Theft Auto VI**, it sets the mood with animated backgrounds, neon glows, and stylish "glitch" text effects.
- **Watch Before You Buy:** Every game comes with a built-in cinematic video player. You can watch official trailers for hits like *Cyberpunk 2077*, *Starfield*, and *Call of Duty* right on the details page without leaving the site.
- **Futuristic Design:** We call it "Glassmorphism." The interface features dark, semi-transparent layers that blur the background, making the content pop with a premium, modern feel.
- **Smooth Interactions:** Everything moves. Buttons glow when you hover, pages fade in smoothly, and the whole experience feels fluid and responsive on any device, whether it's your desktop or your phone.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

If you are a developer and want to see how this works on your own machine:

1.  **Download** the code to your computer.
2.  Open your terminal and **install the necessary tools** (`npm install`).
3.  **Start the app** (`npm run dev`) and open the link shown in your browser.
